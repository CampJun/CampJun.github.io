Gossamer strands entrenched in biomechanical striations,  
electric impulses transmuting quantum vibrations,  
into a digital illusion of separation from the ineffable agent of all Creation.  
A sacrifice of truth on the altar of Mammon,  
a new god arises, decadent sensation.  

A spiritual enucleation.
